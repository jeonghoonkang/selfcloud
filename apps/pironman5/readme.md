## Detials of installation and run (just some part of drivers .. )
- https://github.com/jeonghoonkang/selfcloud/tree/main/devel_opment/pironman5
- Thermal Fan is supported and run by default RaspberryPi5 driver
- In some case, there are system panic down from systemctl management of PIRONMAN5
  - thus SONNO will use periodic application run for safe long-time running
